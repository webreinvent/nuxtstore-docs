We want our community to be a fun and welcoming place for everyone. Here are a few guidelines to help us maintain that:

## Play Nice

- **No cyberbullying or trolling.** (We're all friends here, even if we disagree.)
- **Keep it clean.** (No offensive language or inappropriate content, please.)
- **Respect everyone's opinions.** (Even if they're really wrong.)
- **Be patient and understanding.** (We're all human, and sometimes we make mistakes.)

## Unacceptable Behavior

- **No bullying or hate speech.** (Seriously, it's not cool.)
- **Don't spam or troll.** (It's annoying, and nobody likes an annoying bot.)
- **Respect people's privacy.** (Keep your snooping to a minimum.)

## If Something's Off

If you see something that doesn't feel right, please let us know. We'll investigate and fix or take appropriate action.
