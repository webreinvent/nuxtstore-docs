## BLoC

> BLoC, short for Business Logic Component, enforces a unidirectional data flow, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting testability.

### Principles

- Events Drive State Changes
  - BLoC receives events triggered by user interactions or other parts of the application. These events signal a potential change in the state.
- State Updates via Emitting New States
  - Based on the received event, the BLoC processes it and emits a new state that reflects the updated application state.
- UI Reacts to State Changes
  - The UI observes the state emitted by the BLoC and rebuilds itself accordingly, ensuring the UI always reflects the current state.

### Pros

- Predictable State Flow
  - BLoC enforces a unidirectional data flow, making it easier to reason about how state changes occur within your application.
- Separation of Concerns
  - BLoC separates the UI from the business logic, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Scalability
  - The BLoC pattern scales well for complex applications with intricate state management requirements.
- Improved Testability
  - By isolating state logic within the BLoC, you can write unit tests to ensure the BLoC reacts correctly to different events.
